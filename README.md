# Computer-Graphics

This repository contains code snippets, and examples demonstrating various computer graphics concepts using OpenGL. The repository is intended for anyone interested in learning computer graphics, particularly using OpenGL for 2D and 3D rendering.

Also a project named Metropolis and Meadows .Our OpenGL project, "Metropolis and Meadows: A Journey Between Urban Innovation and Rural Tranquility," visually captures this contrast through an immersive 3D simulation. This journey takes viewers from a bustling city filled with cars, buses, and towering skyscrapers to the calm countryside with green fields, rivers, and traditional wooden houses.
